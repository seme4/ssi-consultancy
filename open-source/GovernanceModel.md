# sameAs Lite Governance Model (draft)

## 1. Overview

Ensuring that sameAs Lite is developed by the community in a structured and transparent way requires a certain degree of governance. This governance model has been adopted to strike a balance between encouraging anyone to make a contribution at any time and maintaining a high level of quality in sameAs Lite and its supporting resources.  This governance model sets out:

* The roles within the project's community and the responsibilities associated with each role.
* How the project supports the community.
* What contributions can be made to the project, how they are made, any conditions the contributions must conform to, who retains copyright of the contributions and the process followed by the project in accepting the contribution.
* The decision-making process in within the project.

## 2. Roles and responsibilities

There are a number of ways to participate in the project. Not all of them involve contributing source code. Simply participating on mailing lists, filing bug reports or enhancement requests, or even just forwarding a paragraph saying how sameAs Lite helped your work is an incredibly valuable form of participation.

There are four roles within the project's community: users, contributors, committers and the project lead.

### 2.1 Users

Users are the people who download and use sameAs Lite or its related online resources, who have a need for sameAs Lite. Without users, there is no reason for the project to exist. Users are encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. Anyone can be a user.

Actions undertaken by users include:

* Downloading and deploying sameAs Lite in their organisations.
* Letting the project know how sameAs Lite has helped them.
* Providing moral support - a 'thank you' goes a long way!
* Offering letters of support for funding applications submitted by the project lead.
* Asking for new features or enhancements to sameAs Lite or its related resources.
* Reporting bugs in sameAs Lite or typos in its related resources.

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find themselves becoming more and more involved. Such users may then go on to become contributors.

### 2.2 Contributors

Contributors are individuals who contribute to the project but either do not have write access to the project resources or have no desire to become committers. They make valuable contributions, such as those outlined below, and submit these through the project's communication tools.

Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process. To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project.

Actions undertaken by contributors include:

* Supporting new users as current users often provide the most effective support for new users.
* Fixing bugs in sameAs Lite and typos in its related resources.
* Implementing enhancements.
* Implementing new features.
* Implementing tests, whether these be automated tests or manual testing protocols.
* Writing documentation e.g. FAQs, HOW-TOs, blog articles or case studies on the deployment of sameAs Lite.
* Assisting with project infrastructure.

As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, they may find that the project lead starts relying on them more and more. When this begins to happen, they may be invited to adopt the role of committer.

Contributions are reviewed by committers and integrated at their discretion. This is an iterative process. Feedback will be given should a contribution be rejected. Before code contributions can be added to the source code repository, a completed Contribution Licence Agreement (CLA) is required from the contributor or their organisation. See 4. Contributions Process below.

### 2.3 Committers

Committers are contributors who have made several valuable contributions to the project and are now relied upon to both write code directly to the project's source code repository and validate and integrate the contributions of others. In many cases they are programmers but it is also possible that they contribute in a different role (for example, updating the web site or managing e-mail lists). Typically, a committer will focus on a specific aspect of the project, and will bring a level of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community and the project lead. The role of committer is not an official one, it is simply a position that influential members of the community will find themselves in as the project lead looks to them for guidance and support.

Committers have no authority over the overall direction of the project. However, they do have the ear of the project lead. It is a committer's job to ensure that the lead is aware of the community's needs and collective objectives, and to help develop or elicit appropriate contributions to the project. Often, committers are given informal control over their specific areas of responsibility, and are assigned rights to directly modify certain areas of the source code. That is, although committers do not have explicit decision-making authority, they will often find that their actions are synonymous with the decisions made by the lead.

If invited to become a committer, or a request to become a committer is granted, a completed Contribution Licence Agreement (CLA) is required from the committer or their organisation. See 4. Contributions Process below.

### 2.4 Project Lead

The project lead is responsible for the overall direction and vision of the project. In addition to making sure that releases are planned correctly and completed on schedule the project lead decides who receives commit access to the source code repository, that is, who can become a committer. This ensures that the quality of the software and the associated documentation remains high and the conceptual integrity of the project is maintained.

The project lead is a benevolent dictator - see 5. Decision-Making Process.

The project lead for sameAs Lite are the original developers of sameAs Lite:

* Hugh Glaser, Chief Architect, Seme4 Ltd, hugh.glaser@seme4.com
* Ian Millard, Senior Technologist, Seme4 Ltd, ian.millard@seme4.com

## 3. Support

All participants in the community are encouraged to provide support for new users within the project management infrastructure. This support is provided as a way of growing the community.

Those seeking support should recognise that all support activity within the project is voluntary and is therefore provided as and when time allows. A user requiring guaranteed response times or results should contact the project lead and discuss whether a support contact can be negotiated. However, for those willing to engage with the project on its own terms, and willing to help support other users, the project's infrastructure is ideal.

## 4. Contribution Process

Anyone can contribute to the development of sameAs Lite, regardless of their skills, as there are many ways to contribute. There follows a summary of what contributions can be made, how they are made, any conditions the contributions must conform to, who retains copyright of the contributions and the process followed by the project in accepting the contribution.

Certain contributions are accepted via the sameAs Lite GitHub repository and issue tracker:

In order to accept any contribution of code we require that you first complete either an Individual or Corporate Contributor's Agreement acknowledging certain terms and conditions for its use. Once this agreement has been completed and the code is accepted then it can be committed to the source code repository.

Two agreements are available to choose from depending on whether you represent an individual or a corporate contributor:

* Seme4-CLA-Individual.doc
* Seme4-CLA-Corporate.doc

## 5. Decision-Making Process

The project runs as a benevolent dictatorship. That is, the community actively contributes to the day-to-day maintenance of the project, but the general strategic line is drawn by the project lead. The project lead is the ultimate authority on decisions, and the project lead's decisions are final. The project lead will, wherever possible, seek consensus on decisions from all committers and is open to reviewing decisions in light of changing circumstances.

The project lead will resolve disputes within the community and to ensure that the project is able to progress in a coordinated way. In turn, it is the community's job to guide the decisions of the project lead through active engagement and contribution.
